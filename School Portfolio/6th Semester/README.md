# IBMs Peripheral Loan

This project came about when IBM asked students to pithc a possible new Peripheral Loan site. The sites main functionality is to manage office owned devices that are
being lent to employees in the office. it helps keep track of who has what device and whom are authorized to have a device. 

For this project, we used React. I acted as Team Leader, and worked on:
  - Frontend creation (about 50% of all sites visited) using React
  - CSS for each page.
  - Security
  - Routing
  - Planning
  - Testing Frontend
  - UX and Ui design
  - QR Code Scanner and Generator
  - Component Creation with React.

I did not operate alone in all this, of course, but I did a fair amount of work on those aspects. 

I was not in charge of backend programming, but I felt it was neccesery to include as it is also a very important part of the program. Plus, it can't run locally without
it. 

IBM has yet to reach out to anyone regarding if they will use aspects of this "pitch" or not.
