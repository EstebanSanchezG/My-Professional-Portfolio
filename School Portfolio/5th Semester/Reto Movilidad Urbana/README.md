# Urban Mobility

This was a challenge set by IBM for suitdent to learn how to use Cloud Foundry, as well as a way for students to learn how to make 3D graphics using scripts instead of
a dedicated 3D modeling and creation tool, whilst also learning how to create multiagent simulations using Python.

For this project, I was in charge of documentation, "city" or model planning, modeler using JavaScript, animator for the city simulation, and I also made the colors for
the model. I didn't get a chance to create the multiagents in Python, but I did help test and debug them later with a small patch.
