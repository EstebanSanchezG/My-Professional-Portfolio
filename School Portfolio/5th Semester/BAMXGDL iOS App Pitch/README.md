# Local Food Bank iOS pitch

For this project, I was in charge of UI design and UX again, but I also worked with Storyboards using Apple's xCode and Swift to create the app. I was also in charge of creating assets for the iOS app.

## Concept

The concept of the app is a video game that teaches everyone about how tough it is to manage a Food Bank, and raising knowledge of the important work these people do to help maintain society well fed. 

We decided to make a game since any other app idea could be replaced with a more simple solution (a direct deposit app would just be a banking app, a news feed app for the bank could just an Instagram account); and the app is supposed to be for the public, not the organization (meaning we could not make an app for the volunteers). Plus, the almost every smart phones user has games installed on their device and play them actively.
